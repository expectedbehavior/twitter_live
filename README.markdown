This is the project for our "Twitter Live" presentation given at the first Rose Unconference on December 5, 2009. The "live" branch is where we coded during the actual presentation. Each of the branches that match /^00*/ mark one of the major points of the talk as described below.


001_getting_started

In this branch, the rails project is made and the "restful_auth" plugin has been applied top the project. You should be able to start the project server, go to /signup, complete the signup, go to /login, and log in to the app. There's no application of any kind and no default route, but the user tests pass.
